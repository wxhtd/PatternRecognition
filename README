This is a project demonstrating image processing process.

In this process, the following procedures were performed:
1. Convert a image file into grayscale 2-dimensional array
2. Apply Gaussian Filter to remove noise
3. Generate histogram from noise filtered grayscale pixels
4. Calculate threshold for object detection
5. Connectivity analysis to label objects
6. Object recognition for circles and squares

To execute the program, please download the .java files, compile and execute TestImage.class.
